📌 Overview

This project was completed as part of Task 2 of my internship with Future Interns. The goal was to analyze an ad campaign dataset from Kaggle using Power BI to uncover insights about campaign performance.

The analysis focuses on key performance metrics such as spend, conversions, and turning raw data into actionable insights for smarter marketing decisions.
